## Explanation:
1. **Server1 and Server2:** Added for redundancy and load balancing.
2. **Load Balancer (HAproxy):** Distributes incoming traffic between Server1 and Server2 using a Round Robin distribution algorithm.
3. **Application Server:** Hosts the application files (codebase) and processes user requests.
4. **Primary and Replica Database Nodes:** Implements a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster for data replication.
5. **User Receives Response:** Users receive responses from the load-balanced application servers.

## Specifics:
- **Load Balancer:** Added for distributing traffic to prevent overloading a single server and ensure better availability.
- **HAproxy Algorithm:** Configured with Round Robin, where each incoming request is distributed sequentially to the available servers.
- **Active-Active vs. Active-Passive:** HAproxy enables Active-Active setup, where both Server1 and Server2 are active and receive traffic simultaneously.
- **Primary-Replica Cluster:** The primary database node handles writes and replicates data to the replica node to ensure data redundancy and availability.
- **Difference between Primary and Replica:** Primary node handles writes while replica node handles reads, providing better scalability and read performance.

## Issues:
- **Single Point of Failure (SPOF):** If the load balancer or any server fails, the service is affected.
- **Security Issues:** No firewall or HTTPS raises security concerns.
- **Monitoring Missing:** No monitoring tools are depicted for tracking performance and issues.
